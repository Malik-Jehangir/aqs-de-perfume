      <p>
        AQS (عكس) – &quot;Reflection&quot; – was born from a simple frustration: everyone
        smells the same. Viral perfumes, clones, mass-produced scents pretending to be
        luxury. We wanted something different: a scent that feels like YOU.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aqs was built on the road – not in a boardroom. Nights driving from city to city,
        country to country. Meeting craftsmen who devoted their lives to perfecting single
        notes. Searching for rare ingredients that most brands never touch.
      </p>
      <p>
        We spent months on formulas. Threw away batches that didn&apos;t feel right. Faced
        doubt, embarrassment, and the temptation to quit. But we didn&apos;t. Because this
        isn&apos;t just about perfume. It&apos;s about belief, friendship, and refusing to
        settle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every AQS fragrance is matured for 2 years. In a world that wants everything
        instantly, we chose patience. Because depth takes time. Because your reflection
        deserves more than something rushed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, we&apos;re a perfume house in Bahrain. Tomorrow, AQS will be a global symbol
        of handcrafted luxury – perfume, clothing, leather, timepieces – all built with the
        same obsession and respect.
